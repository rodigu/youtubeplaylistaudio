# youtubeplaylistaudio
Downloads audios from a youtube playlist into a folder.
Requires youtube-dl and Python 3. But I don't think it works for windows.

Give it the playlist link (has to be a public playlist) and a folder name, and you are ready to go.
It will download all the audios in the playlist into that folder. Don't use spaces when naming the folder or it will not work.

Use it with moderation and permission from the authors of the audios.
